# SUNY Maritime Coding Club

Coding club organized by Professor Kwon at SUNY Maritime,
led by myself.

This semester we want to create web applications. We will start with basics of HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Then we will look at some libraries/frameworks; which ones will depend on what students want to do. (Since I'm working with THREE and Vue now, those will be the default.)

Filenames correspond to date of meeting (month-date.html/js/css).
Probably will reorganize them by folders when we have more meetings.
