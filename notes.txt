What is JavaScript event loop

JS heap and stack
-single thread
-when encounter something from WebAPI (like setTimeout, xhttp stuff)
	will send it to WebAPI part of the browser
WebAPIs
-performs the function (setTimeout, sends xhttp request etc)
-and sends the callback function to the event loop
Event Loop
-is simply a queue of functions waiting to be executed
-executes the next function when the call stack is empty

simple example:
setTimeout(mycallback, 0) simply runs mycallback when everything in the main
file is done executing, in particular, after window loads


Basic server:
python3 -m http.server


interacting with DOM
-in the F12 menu, top left corner is node picker
-to refer to a DOM element in the console,
	can right-click the element in Inspector and "Use in Console"
	a temp0 object will appear in the console input line



some Vue stuff:
-@click has issues when the function involves "this"
 (e.g. @click="someObject.method", and method has this.x = ...)
 workaround:
 @click="() => {someObject.method();}"
